# Commands and Modals

In this issue, you will be learning about commands and modals. Commands are a shorthand way to perform an action in Slack. In order to invoke an app with a command, you just need to type '/' in a message field. Modals are another type of view that a Slack app can have. Read [this article](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/modals) to learn more about modals. 



## Building an App

Your task is to build an app that creates a modal with the command 'ticket'. When this command is invoked, a modal should pop up asking the user any question you'd like, then giving them a text field for their response. The modal should also include a submit button, which does not require a listener for now. 

Refer to the following template for building a command:

```javascript
// Listen for a slash command invocation
app.command('/<name of command>', async ({ ack, body, client }) => {
  // Acknowledge the command request
  await ack();

  try {
    // Call views.open with the built-in client
    const result = await client.views.open({
      // Pass a valid trigger_id within 3 seconds of receiving it
      trigger_id: body.trigger_id,
      // View payload
      view: {
        type: '<type_of_view>',
        // View identifier
        callback_id: 'view_1',
        title: {
          type: 'plain_text',
          text: '<title>'
        },
        submit: {
          type: 'plain_text',
          text: 'Submit'
        }
      }
    });
    console.log(result);
  }
  catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
});

```

 

> **Hint**: there should be a block kit in the modal
